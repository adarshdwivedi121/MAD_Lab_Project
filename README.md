This project aims towards creating an Earthquake and Tsunami Alert
Application. There are more than 70 occurences of Seismic Activity everyday
around the World. This means that there are at least 3 Earthquakes occuring
every hour. Thus, this increases the risk for people especially those living in
coastal areas and places near fault lines. This App utilizes real time Data
provided by the servers from the United States Geological Survey and
provides the user with a list of Earthquakes happening worldwide.
This App will also keep track of the seismic activity around the user and will
notify you if you are in the vicinity of an Earthquake, which is either Moderate
or above in the Richter Scale, or a Tsunami. This will help alert the user and
give them a heads up to take necessary precautions to ensure their safety.
We have planned to put the following functionalities:
1. Provide list of Earthquakes to user realtime
2. Provide a Detailed info of the Selected Earthquake which includes the
Location, Magnitude, Location on Map, seismic lines, etc
3. Add filters to modify the list based on Date, Magnitude and Location
4. Notification Service to notify user of an Earthquake in the their vicinity
5. Notification Service to notify user of any Tsunami occuring in their
vicinity
6. Real time tracking of Multiple locations.
